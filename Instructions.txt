                          -- Chocolatey Exercise --

1. Open the 'notepadplusplus.nuspec', 'example.nuspec' and 'ChocolateyInstall.ps1' files using a text editor.

2. Fill in the tags in 'notepadplusplus.nuspec' using 'example.nuspec' as a guide but using Notepad++ details. 

3. Run the Command Prompt as Admin

4. Navigate to the location of your nuspec file using "cd" etc

5. Run the command "cpack notepadplusplus.nuspec". If successful you will see a file created called "notepad.6.8.3.nupkg". This is your chocolatey package. Yay!

6. Now open a browser and go to "https://www.myget.org/" and create an account, we will be hosting our packages on here.

7. Once your account is set up and verified, create a feed and click 'Add a Package'.

8. Return to Command Prompt or PowerShell (if you prefer) as long as you run as ADMIN, and run this code to install chocolatey
    ---- For Command Prompt, run "@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"

    ---- For Powershell, run "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))"

    NOTE: If using PowerShell you may need to change your execution policy to allow you to run the scripts, use "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned"

9. Then use the chocolatey install command to install your new package, hosted on your MyGet feed: "cinst notepadplusplus -source https://www.myget.org/F/yourfeednamehere"

10. Watch the chocolatey magic before your eyes! Green messages are good, and type 'yes' to continue!
